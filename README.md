# EV-Growth-Analysis-TSA
In this project I used SARIMA architecture to train a model which forecasts the number of registrations of EV in India in year 2023. The Data is collected from https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/vahan4dashboard/vahan/view/reportview.xhtml. The project also uses anomaly detection to detect the Covid pandemic.
